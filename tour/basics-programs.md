To get code to the cloud, you write Pulumi programs.

Programs are written in your language of choice.  Pulumi currently supports JavaScript and TypeScript, using Node.js,
and Python.  For a customized experience, please choose your language in the upper-right corner of this page.

> More languages are on their way!

Pulumi programs are just like usual programs, except for a few important points:

* They express the cloud resources required by your program
* You will run them using the `pulumi` CLI, not by invoking them directly
* The result is a plan of action that may be previewed or carried out by the Pulumi runtime

Those familiar with [infrastructure as code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_Code) will feel at home.
Don't worry if you're not -- you'll be an expert by the end of this tour.
