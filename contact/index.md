# Contact Us

Please feel free to contact us anytime with any questions or comments you may have.

Until we launch the company publicly, our [GitHub](https://github.com/pulumi) and [Slack](https://pulumi.slack.com)
channels may or may not be accessible.  They are the easiest way to share code and ideas, however, so please use them
if you have access to them.

Our email address is [support@pulumi.com](mailto:support@pulumi.com) which you are always welcome to use.

Our office address is

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;520 E Denny Way<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seattle, WA 98122
