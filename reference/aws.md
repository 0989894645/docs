Pulumi supports deploying programs to Amazon Web Services (AWS) using any of the available services in AWS.

To configure Pulumi for AWS, please [head on over to the installation page](/install/aws.html).

The AWS provider is open source and available in the [pulumi/pulumi-aws](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-aws)
repo.  Full API documentation is available [here](./pkg/nodejs/@pulumi/aws/index.html).

We also have a number interesting examples of using AWS in [our examples repo](https://github.com/pulumi/examples).
Our [Quickstart Tutorials](/quickstarts) also cover a lot of AWS ground, including
[containers](https://pulumi.io/quickstart/aws-containers.html),
[serverless functions](https://pulumi.io/quickstart/aws-rest-api.html),
[infrastructure](https://pulumi.io/quickstart/aws-ec2.html), and the
[intersection of all three](https://pulumi.io/quickstart/aws-extract-thumbnail.html).

> More detailed documentation for AWS is on its way! In the meantime, please don't hesitate to reach us on GitHub,
> Slack, or any of the usual means, if you have any questions or comments.
