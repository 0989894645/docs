Pulumi is a open-source tool and service that makes it easier to build modern cloud applications on AWS, Azure, GCP, and Kubernetes.

In the quickstarts and examples below, you will see how Pulumi can be used to build serverless applications, manage low-level infrastrucutre, orchestrate containers and do everything in between. Each example highlights how pulumi programs written in JavaScript or Python can define and version immutable infrastructure using both raw cloud resources, as well as higher-level components built on top of them.
